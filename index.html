                <h2>new cs rating</h2>
                <h3>go beyond global with the new cS rating</h3>
                <p>
                    Your CS Rating is a visible measurement of your
                    Counter-Strike performance, and it will determine where you
                    stand on global and regional leaderboards. To get your CS
                    Rating, play matches in the updated Premier mode (our Active
                    Duty Pick-Ban competitive mode) either on your own or with
                    your friends.

                    gunfire, and explosions.

                            gameplay events, creating new opportunities. Bullets
                            and HE grenades can push smoke to briefly clear
                            sightlines or expand occlusion.

                            unified lighting system allowing for more realistic
                            light and color.
